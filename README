Targets:

iplogin2	The main server daemon. Handles user login/logout. Statically linked and stripped.
iladmin		A simple menu-based administration client - see ILADMIN_DEFS in the Makefile
libilglue.a	Glue for linking your own clients
acclib_test.so	Accounting library example

ilcmd		A single-command administration client
iladmin_random	Test client sending random commands from a list
find_interface	Test program for the route lookup code
testipt		Bulk tester for the iptables filter code

Prerequisites:

The openssl library libcrypto.a must be installed, along with the accompanying include files.
The libwrap.a library and tcpd.h from tcp_wrappers must be installed
A version (1.2.5 works) of the 'iptables' package should be unpacked in this directory, and the symbolic link 'iptables' updated to point to the subdirectory in question.


-----------------------------------
2.2.4
Changed the handling of filterchain specs, to allow for source, destination
and bidirectional filters, and added an option for specifying target to the
filter lines. Syntax: [table]:chain[/[sdb]][>target] where "s", "d" and "b"
denotes "source", "destination" and "both", respectively. The default value
for "table" is "filter", for "direction" "s" and for "target" "ACCEPT".
Added a better kind of command dispatcher, by unifying the command handler
functions and adding them to the command definition array. This saved on a
huge switch() statement and enabled me to distribute the server configuration
struct more freely throughout the program.
By distributing the config struct, I managed to make the block chain
parameters dynamic and configurable, thus adding more configuration params
to the conffile. See config.h for details.
