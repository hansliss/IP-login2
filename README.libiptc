For iptables prior to 1.2.5:

The following fix must be added to libiptc.c, in order to
avoid a problem with the iptables subsystem eating up file
descriptors.

Early in TC_INIT():

Change the following line:
 	sockfd = socket(TC_AF, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_RAW);

to read
 	if (sockfd < 0)
 	  sockfd = socket(TC_AF, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_RAW);
