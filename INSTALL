Don't try to build this on non-Linux systems. It will not work.

You need sources for iptables to compile this, because the build
process will link the target statically to the iptables libraries,
which have to be built non-shared. The Makefile can do this for you,
but you will have to 'make clean' in you iptables directory and point
it out to 'configure'. IP-login2 handles at least versions 1.2.5 - 1.2.7a
and the configure script will try to figure out which version of iptables
you have.

./configure --with-iptables-source=/usr/local/src/iptables-1.2.5

You will also need to have full permissions in the iptables source
directory, obviously.

You need to have OpenSSL libraries installed to compile iplogin2, too.
If they're not in a standard place, you can point configure to them,
with '--with-openssl=<dir>'.

To get iplogin2 up and running you need a configuration file. Edit
a copy of iplogin2.conf.sample to suit your needs and save it as
iplogin2.conf.
You will also need to add a service definition to /etc/services,
something like this:
	iplogin2	4711/tcp

It is a good idea to start iplogin2 from init (8), and this can
be accomplished by adding a line to /etc/inittab:

il:5:respawn:/opt/iplogin2/bin/iplogin2 /opt/iplogin2/etc/iplogin2.conf nomad -l /var/spool/iplogin2.users
