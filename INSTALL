To get iplogin2 up and running you need a configuration file. Edit
a copy of iplogin.conf.sample to suit your needs and save it as
iplogin.conf.
You will also need to add a service definition to /etc/services,
like this:
	iplogin2	4711/tcp

It is a good idea to start iplogin2 from init (8), and this can
be accomplished by adding a line to /etc/inittab:

il:5:respawn:/opt/iplogin2/bin/iplogin2 /opt/iplogin2/etc/iplogin2.conf nomad -l /var/spool/iplogin2.users
